Insurance Cost Prediction 

Implemented a machine learning model for predicting insurance costs based on demographic and lifestyle factors.

Technologies Used:

Python
Libraries: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn


Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of key features.
Visualized essential aspects, including the age and sex distribution, using seaborn and matplotlib.
Preprocessed the data, converting categorical variables to numerical format for model training.
Utilized Linear Regression for modeling the relationship between input features and insurance charges.
Evaluated model performance using R-squared, achieving high scores on both training and testing datasets.
